Estimating g(x) given f(x)

1) O(n)

2) O(n^2)

3) O(n^5)

4) O(n^3)

5) O((n^2)*log(n))

6) O(n log(n))

Counting Operations to Produce Polynomials

1) O(1)

2) O(n^2)

3) O(n^2)

4) O(n)

More Advanced Practice

1) O(log(n))
You only need to loop one more time every time the value doubles for binary search in a worst-case scenario, so a log base 2 would make sense as the Big O.

2) O(n^2)
Worst-case scenario for bubble sort is (n*n+1)/2, and n^2 is the largest, so it's the Big O.
